# Rubik's Cube Solver

----
## Algorithms :
- DFS
- ID-DFS: Iterative Deepening, Depth first Search
- BFS

---
## Rubik's Cube models :
- 3D Array (6 x 3 x 3) [6 Faces x 3 rows x 3 col]
- 1D Array (size = 54)
- Bit Board (array<bitset<27>, 6>) [Each bitset will represent a Face; each 3-bits group will represent the color on a square of the Face]
